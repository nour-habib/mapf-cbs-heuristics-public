MAPF: Implementation of CBS with Heuristics

This is a group project for a 4th year level course in Intelligent Systems. 

Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a well known path finding algorithm that has proved to provide effective results. Current research works has provided several methods to improve its performance, including admissible heuristics. In this paper, our focus is on cardinal, semi and non-cardinal conflicts. This involves implement- ing Conflict Graph (CG), Dependency Graph (DG) and Weighted Dependency Graph (WDG) heuristics. By testing against 8x8 maps, our results will show an increase in run-time and percentage of solved instances, and a decrease in number of nodes expanded.
